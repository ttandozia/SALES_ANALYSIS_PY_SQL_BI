**Hello!**

A project built for Namaste Technologies, Toronto, ON, Canada.

Here you'll find an end to end analysis about the first quarter namaste's sales. Some highlights:

- Data Analysis built-in Python + SQL
- API connection to identify currency rates between the USA and Canada's dollar;
- Data Visualization developed in Tableau. You can find a print at the end of the code and also in this link: https://tabsoft.co/35AKLqs
- SQL database structured to maintain needed databases.
